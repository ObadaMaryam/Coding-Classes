            <h1>About Birds</h1>
            <p>
            Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (Latin: [ˈaveːs]), characterised by feathers,
            toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet
            lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft
            2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species and they are split into 44 orders.

            <h1>About Animals</h1>
            <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]). With few
            exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce
            sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade,
            meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of
            which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates.</p>
