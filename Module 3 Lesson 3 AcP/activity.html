            My favourite hobby is reading books. I like to read different kinds of books such as; novel, biography and history
            books. Reading books helps me to learn new things and improve my vocabulary. I usually read books in my free time
            especially before going to bed. One the benefits of reading book is that it improves my imagination and creativity. I
            can imagine the characters, the places and the events in the book. Reading books also makes me more curious and open
            minded about different topics and cultures. Another benefit of reading books is that it relaxes me and reduces my
            stress. When I read books I forget about my problems and worries for a while.

            great pleasure, it gives me peace of mind and satisfaction. It is also a great source of recreation. I enjoy gardening
            because it makes me happy, creative, and cheerful. If you believe it or not gardening helps to create a healthier
