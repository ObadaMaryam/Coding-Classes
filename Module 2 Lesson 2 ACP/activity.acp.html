        <h1>About My Pet</h1>
        <p>My pet male cat, name is Prince ,Cato , [color] tabby with striking green eyes. He's a playful and affectionate
        companion, often curling up on my lap for a cuddle while purring softly. Prince loves to chase toys around the
        house, especially anything with a feather, and is particularly fond of napping in sunbeams on the living room floor.
        Though he can be a bit mischievous sometimes, his sweet nature and playful antics make him a cherished member of our
        family.</p>
