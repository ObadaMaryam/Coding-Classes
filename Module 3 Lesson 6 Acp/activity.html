            <h4 id="Hobbies">My Hobbies</h4>
            <p>My hobby is painting. Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by colors, strokes, and the ability to express my
            feelings on a canvas. Painting gives me the freedom to unleash my imagination and create visuals that tell stories
            without words. Whether itâ€™s using acrylics, watercolors, or oil, each medium allows me to explore different techniques
            and styles, contributing to my artistic growth.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 id="Skills">My Skills</h4>
            <p>Data analysts and data scientists are in high demand. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in
            data science and analytics is projected to grow by 31% from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all
            occupations. This statistic is hardly surprising. Data has become more essential than ever, and those who can work with
            data to extract meaningful insights are highly valued.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 id="Pet">Favourite Pet</h4>
            <p>Cats are one of the most popular and lovable pets in the world. They are small, furry animals known for their playful
            and curious nature. Cats have sharp claws and teeth, which they use for hunting and climbing. They are very clean
            animals and groom themselves by licking their fur.</p>
